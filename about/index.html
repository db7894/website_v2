			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm a Pakistani-American (US-born)--fun fact: I've probably spent as many New Year's in Lahore as in the States.

          My interests include both theory and application of techniques in machine learning and data science. I care a lot about 
          considering the effect of the systems and tools I build on the real world and finding ways to minimize cognitive bias in 
          decision-making processes. I enjoy writing from time to time on topics such as South Asian American identity.

          In my free time, I love reading books and articles about topics from philosophy to politics. I enjoy playing the violin 
          and staying active, and I'm a Bollywood addict.</p>
