        		<h1>Hi! I'm Daniel Bashir.</h1>
				<p>I'm a third-year Joint Major in Computer Science and Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College. My coursework at Harvey Mudd has included a wide survey of STEM subjects including Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, and so on from Harvey Mudd's Core. Recent courses I've taken have focused on topics and areas such as machine learning, statistics, and algorithms. In addition, my passion for other areas has led me to take courses in Economics, Political Science, and Philosophy. <a href="/about">More info here</a></p>
